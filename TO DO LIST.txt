TO DO
================//
+ make the video
+ revert to weekly branch
+ uncomment bonk
+ delete script from to do list
+ test sim in dedicated server mod
+ if removal of load time was acceptable, realign script with mod then test
+ finalise the workshop descriptions
+ find out if you can move entity with mouse input
+ release on thursday night!
+ change all variables to camel case exept const'
+ const to caps and underscores
+ empty function calls should have their space removed except method calls
+ turn all public fields into properties
+ evaluate where private is considered good placement
+ ingame script needs a conventional revision
+ adjacentevaluation() should have a pattern where secondary is always assigned after primary; semantics
+ design a pattern mandate for adjacent() that minimises the possibility of fixing words at the cost of breaking them
+ design a class that reports known adjacent words and prints a list of changes in success
+ some state paths can be combined in adjacent evaulation. this one is easy to screw up but dont worry just fix it when someeone reports it
+ move adjacent word comments beside their logic component


REMINDERS
====================//
+ test every new word before signing off
+ slowly move dictionary words into adjacentevaluation(). reason: broader reach
+ remember to update ships too
+ and update github

BROKEN WORDS / WORDS MOVING FROM PRIMARY TO BACKUP
