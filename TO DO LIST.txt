TO DO
================//
+ put all comment words in the debugger
+ make a new parameter when creating a SentenceProcession which will only play a sound if not debugging.
+ word listing debugger is still go. remember to discard spaces from results
+ make it point out double ups as well

+ some state paths can be combined in adjacent evaulation. this one is easy to screw up
+ bring back silent blocks?

+ add shi and chi (this is a phrase by phrase check. dont rush this.)
SHI = {SIH, HIH,}, 
CHI = {KIH, HIH,}, {TIH, SIH, HIH,},
ERR = {RIH}

+ study old work in saved audacity project ._.
+ marek PIH is too quiet. marek phonemes need to be the same length; even small ones. drag them out
+ see if its feasible to use marek consonants
+ test words before overwriting

+ add new words.
+ create new private mod and script just for testing
+ edit the batch file to point to this new directory

+ an interface should be designed for SentenceProcession so that all different voices can have the same structure, but different spacing when needed
+ use autotune free trial to create pitch.

+ make a new block with a sound emitter entity? maybe

+ find out if you can move entity with mouse input

+ document everything
