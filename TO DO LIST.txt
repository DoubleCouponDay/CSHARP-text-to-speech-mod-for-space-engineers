+ see if its feasible to use marek consonants
+ test words before overwriting

+ add new words.
+ create new private mod and script just for testing
+ edit the batch file to point to this new directory

+ an interface should be designed for SentenceProcession so that all different voices can have the same structure, but different spacing when needed
+ use autotune free trial to create pitch.

+ make a new block with a sound emitter entity? maybe

+ find out if you can move entity with mouse input

+ document everything
