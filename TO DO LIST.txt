TO DO
================//
+ finish intonation for all voices
	+ why am I injecting intonationtype into pronunciation?
	+ Because I apply the intonation number inside pronunciation
	+ Tasks objective is to select the right number to append to each phoneme.
		First I have some settings when implementing task factory; basic stuff and not finalized until testing.
		Then I have to make a selecting algorithm in gladosIntonation.
	+ what was my previous work trying to achieve and do I agree with it?
		


+ fix everything :^)

+ add computer voice support?

+ new block
	+ outputmanager may need to be refactored so that sound players location is set using injection
	+ think of good object builder for block. cant be terminal block
	+ block should not play in realistic mode.
	+ figure out how to implement new buttons and a text box.
    MyAPIGateway.TerminalControls.CustomControlGetter += TerminalControls_CustomControlGetter;
    then
    private static void TerminalControls_CustomControlGetter(IMyTerminalBlock block, List<IMyTerminalControl> controls)

    remove needed entries from controls argument(edited)

+ make basic number support.

+ test
+ fix everything :^)

+ FINISH
