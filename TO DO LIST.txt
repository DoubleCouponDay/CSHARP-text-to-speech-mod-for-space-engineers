BROKEN WORDS
=================//

 


TO DO
================//
+ print by taking the serialised words and using them as keys for accessing the results dictionary. 
	-flag lowercase keys
	-increment tallies
	-increment nonmatchcount if switch was flipped during a comparison loop

+ finish refactoring optionaldebugger

+ optional debugger uses outputmanager in an old way. how do i update it?
	-the phoneme results are taken care of but getting the signal to put down some of the bool flags is challenging in in a separate thread.
	-I could use an event which the debugger would subscribe to. Any unforseen consequences?	

+ sentencesNonSpacedResultsFinished event
+ CurrentWordChanged event
+ what are the back slashes for in HawkingIntonation?

+ exception enumeration already finished: optionaldebugger line 248
	solution: 
	-properties arent returned every tick. need a new way of storing that info. 
	wait until end of task?
	-use foreach on the dictionary instead of enumerator,	
	-throw exception if the two tables arent the same length	

+ place optional debugger's bool duplicate exists in the result sheet
		

+ test adjacentresults with dictionary words with values longer than their keys
+ test Intonation is accurate during dictionary dumps

+ implement phoneme choosing for glados
+ test async task
+ test cancellation token source in output manager
+ fix everything :^)

+ add computer voice support

+ think of good object builder for block. cant be terminal block
+ block should not play in realistic mode.
+ figure out how to implement new buttons and a text box.
    MyAPIGateway.TerminalControls.CustomControlGetter += TerminalControls_CustomControlGetter;
    then
    private static void TerminalControls_CustomControlGetter(IMyTerminalBlock block, List<IMyTerminalControl> controls)

    remove needed entries from controls argument(edited)

+ read the log for PrettyScaryDictionary crash. multithreading?

+ make basic number support.

+ test
+ fix everything :^)

+ FINISH
