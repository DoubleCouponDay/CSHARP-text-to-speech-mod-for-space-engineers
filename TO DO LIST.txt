BROKEN WORDS
=================//



TO DO
================//
+ fix non matching words.

+ make backup copy of Pronunciation
+ analyse the best looking letter pattern to see if its actually better
+ some state paths can be combined in adjacent evaulation.  this involves removing else scenarios. TEST AFTER EVERY LETTER.

+ record new phonemes
SHI = {SIH, HIH}, 
CHI = {KIH, HIH}, {TIH, SIH, HIH},
ERR = {RIH}
+ replace them in the debuger,dictionary,adjacent
+ fix the resulting mess
+ replace instances of "AOW" with UHH OHH (dont rush this)

+ study old work in saved audacity project ._.
+ marek PIH is too quiet. marek phonemes need to be the same length; even small ones. drag them out
+ see if its feasible to use marek consonants
+ test words before overwriting

+ record madden and glados phonemes
+ use autotune free trial to create pitch for those two?
+ SentenceProcession should become an interface/base class (idk which one yet)
+ create HawkingVoice, GladosVoice, MarekVoice, ComputerVoice classes which inherit SentenceProgression

+ make a new block with a sound emitter entity

+ find out if you can move entity with mouse input

+ commission some artwork of hawking, SE suit, glados on the moon around the TTS block

+ create documentation and flow charts.
