TO DO
================//

+ update script ships
+ upload the script
+ make the video
+ test sim in dedicated server; mod and script
+ find out if you can move entity with mouse input
+ release!
+ change all variables to camel case exept const'
+ empty function calls should have their space removed except method calls
+ turn all public fields into properties
+ remove the private keyword from the entire project
+ ingame script needs a conventional revision
+ adjacentevaluation() should have a pattern where secondary is always assigned after primary
+ some state paths can be combined in adjacent evaulation. this one is easy to screw up but dont worry just fix it when someeone reports it
+ move adjacent word comments beside their logic component

REMINDERS
====================//
+ test every new word before signing off
+ slowly move dictionary words into adjacentevaluation(). reason: broader reach

BROKEN WORDS / WORDS MOVING FROM PRIMARY TO BACKUP
=================//
